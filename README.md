Go Unit Testing Tutorial (Pluralsight CodeLab)
This project is based on the Pluralsight Go unit testing tutorial.

It includes example code for practicing Go unit testing, using best practices around project structure, modules, and basic Go syntax.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
go

GoUnitTestingTutorialPSCodeLab/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum         (optional, generated by Go)
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ (additional .go files if needed)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
ðŸš€ Getting Started
Make sure you have Go installed. (Recommended Go 1.18+)

Check your Go version:

bash
Copy
Edit
go version
1. Install Dependencies
If go.sum is missing or outdated, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
go mod tidy
This will ensure all required modules are downloaded.

2. Run the Application
To run the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
go run main.go
or, to build and execute:

bash
Copy
Edit
go build
./GoUnitTestingTutorialPSCodeLab
3. Running Tests
If you add or already have unit tests (*_test.go files), you can run them with:

bash
Copy
Edit
go test ./...
ðŸ“š Notes
This project was structured to run directly from a single folder for simplicity.

Original tutorial steps (step2, step3, etc.) were consolidated for ease of use.

Folder .bin/ and .checks/ are not needed for running the code and can be ignored.

ðŸ›  Requirements
Go (1.18 or newer recommended)

A code editor like Visual Studio Code with the Go extension installed.
